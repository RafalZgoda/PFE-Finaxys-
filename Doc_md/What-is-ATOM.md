ATOM ([official website](http://atom.univ-lille1.fr/)) is a general environment for agent-based simulations of stock markets.
This simulator is able to closely reproduce the behaviour of most order-driven markets and is more specifically tailored for the NYSE Euronext stock exchange.
ATOM is able to efficiently generate, play or replay order flows for intra and extra-days and can be used to design experiments mixing human beings and artificial traders.
